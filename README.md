# Isolation
Remake of the game "Isolation".


Coded in C# as an assignment in BME 121 Digital Computation as apart of the Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Degree for the University of Waterloo.

After downloading and extracting the file, run the program from the command line using 'dotnet run'.

Note: There was no automatic ending to the game required for this assignment. This will be a feature added upon future iterations.
